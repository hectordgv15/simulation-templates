field_constraints:
  specifications: |
    - Extract only ratios explicitly presented per currency (one ratio value per currency) with the currency clearly indicated in the same row/column/label.
    - Accept ratios labeled "interest coverage", "interest cover", "ICR", or a clearly defined equivalent metric stated as a ratio.
    - If ratios are facility-specific and currencies map to facilities, extract only when the currency is explicitly stated alongside the ratio (not inferred from facility currency).
    - Preserve the ratio exactly as stated (including decimals, "x", "times", or ratio format) and keep the reporting date/period context when provided.
    - If the disclosure presents a table by currency with multiple columns (e.g., requirement, actual), extract the "actual" (or equivalent) ratio value per currency when explicitly labeled.

  exclusions: |
    - Do not calculate any ratio from EBITDA/EBIT/interest expense, net finance costs, or any other components.
    - Do not infer currency assignment from segment, geography, lender, facility name, or debt currency unless the ratio row/column explicitly states the currency.
    - Do not extract ratios that are not interest coverage (e.g., leverage ratios, net debt/EBITDA, fixed-charge cover) unless explicitly titled as interest coverage.
    - Do not use sensitivity, scenario, or pro-forma ratios unless explicitly stated as the reported ratio by currency.
