field_type: quantitative
area: Interest-rate risk associated with debt

operational_definition: |
  Quantitative interest-rate sensitivity comprised of:
    - The positive rate increase applied in the sensitivity analysis (X%).
    - The associated monetary impact on profit or loss (P&L) resulting from that increase.

field_constraints:
  specifications: |
    - Always extract two linked components: the positive rate shock applied (+X bps or +Y%) and the monetary impact on profit or loss (P&L) resulting from that shock.
    - Prioritize the positive increase scenario ("up", "increase"). If +/- or up/down are disclosed, select the "up" scenario.
    - If multiple positive scenarios are disclosed (e.g., +50 bps and +100 bps), select the standard or primary scenario reported (typically the first one or the one explicitly described as the base scenario in the sensitivity analysis).
    - If results are disclosed by portfolios/currencies and an explicit consolidated total for P&L is provided, extract the consolidated total.
    - Accept "net interest income (NII) impact" only where the document explicitly presents it as an effect on profit or loss.

  exclusions: |
    - Any impact on equity and/or other comprehensive income (equity, OCI, FVOCI, reserves, "other comprehensive income").
    - Sensitivity/impact on fair value recognized in equity (where it is not identified as P&L).
    - Complex macro stress tests or non-comparable scenarios where the effect is not expressed as a simple +X bps or +Y% shock.
    - Non-monetary metrics or items without a direct profit or loss effect: VaR, duration, gap, EVE/EV, limits, policies, hedge ratios, ranges.
    - Derivative amounts (fair value or notional) unless explicitly identified as the P&L impact of the shock.
