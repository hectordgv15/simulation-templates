field_name: Sensitivity of operating cash flow to interest rates
field_id: "063"
field_alias: cfo_ir_sensitivity
area: Corporate Finance / Financial Risks

operational_definition: |
  Sensitivity of operating cash flow (CFO) to changes in interest rates. This includes both direct sensitivity
  (e.g., regulated or contractual revenues that adjust through indices linked to inflation/rates; tariff review
  mechanisms; regulated remuneration referenced to sovereign yield curves) and indirect sensitivity
  (e.g., correlation between nominal rates and inflation that triggers price indexation; changes in demand/volumes;
  working-capital effects through collections/payments; and variations in indexed operating costs or costs with
  pass-through mechanisms).

extract_parameters: |
    - **Published sensitivities and scenarios:** change in CFO (or CFO components) under rate and/or inflation shocks
      (e.g., ±100 bps, ±1% CPI), including horizon and units.
    - **Indexation mechanisms:** CPI/HICP (or other indices), formula (if disclosed), frequency (monthly/quarterly/annual),
      lag (e.g., 12-month delay), caps/floors, and true-up/regularization mechanisms (ex post adjustment).
    - **Regulatory framework:** explicit references to curves/yields, regulated WACC methodology, periodic reviews,
      parameters and dates, and how this flows through to revenues/cash receipts.
    - **Demand/volume channel:** demand elasticity or volume/consumption changes attributed to the rate environment
      (only where the text explicitly links the two).
    - **Working capital:** DSO/DPO, delinquencies, inventories, collateral/margins, and any quantified sensitivity or
      statements linking rates or inflation to these items.
    - **Indexed operating costs:** material cost lines with indexation or pass-through (e.g., supply contracts), with
      evidence of formula/index/frequency where available.
    - **Asymmetries/thresholds:** rules such as "up to X%", "above Y", bands, regulatory limits, or contractual step-ups.
