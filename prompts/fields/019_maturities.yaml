area: Liquidity / refinancing risk associated with debt

operational_definition: |
  Structured schedule of debt maturities at period-end, detailing outstanding nominal/principal amounts
  allocated to explicit maturity years (e.g., 2026, 2027, …), with disaggregation by whatever breakdown
  the report discloses (e.g., instrument/type, and when available counterparty/lender and/or currency).

field_constraints:
  specifications: |
    - Extract the debt maturity schedule as of the reporting period-end, prioritizing nominal amounts / outstanding principal.
    - Record maturities by explicit calendar year (YYYY), using only the breakdown dimensions that are actually presented in the relevant table/section.
      Typical (optional) dimensions may include:
        - instrument name/type (e.g., "Senior Notes 2028", "Term Loan", "RCF drawdown")
        - counterparty / lender / issuer class (e.g., bank, syndicate, bondholders)
        - debt category/label as disclosed (e.g., "Bonds and notes", "Loans") when the disclosure is at category level
    - Do not require all dimensions. Extract using only the labels available in the disclosure:
      - If the table presents totals by year only, use a single label such as "Total debt" (or the closest disclosed equivalent).
    - If the table is a matrix (rows = breakdown items, columns = years):
      - Create one record for each (breakdown item(s), year) combination with an amount > 0.
      - If multiple dimensions are shown concurrently (e.g., instrument + currency), prioritize the instrument dimension.
    - If currency is not specified per row but is clearly stated for the entire table/section, apply it to all records.
    - If no currency is disclosed, leave the currency field blank/null; do not infer.
    - If both "contractual cash flows" and "principal/nominal" are presented, prioritize principal/nominal.
    - Include totals only when explicitly disclosed (e.g., "Total debt maturities"); do not compute missing totals.


  exclusions: |
    - Trade payables, provisions, pensions, tax liabilities, and other operating/non-financing liabilities not classified as debt.
    - Derivatives (fair value amounts, hedge balances, and notional amounts), unless the disclosure explicitly presents them as debt principal/nominal.
    - Interest expense, coupon/interest payment schedules, and amortised cost movements (e.g., premiums/discounts, transaction costs, EIR unwind), unless the table explicitly states the figures represent outstanding principal/nominal.
    - Maturity buckets that are not mapped to explicit calendar years; no conversion to years via assumptions or approximations.
    - "Net debt" figures or reconciliations that offset debt with cash, unless they provide an explicit debt maturity schedule by calendar year.
