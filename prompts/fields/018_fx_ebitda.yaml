area: Profitability by currency / FX exposure of operating performance

operational_definition: |
  Monetary amount of EBITDA explicitly disclosed broken down by currency, showing EBITDA generated in each currency for a
  stated reporting period. The field requires the reported EBITDA values as presented, together with their corresponding
  currency identifiers, and must reflect EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) as labeled
  in the document, not a derived or proxy metric.

field_constraints:
  specifications: |
    - Extract only EBITDA amounts explicitly labeled as "EBITDA" (or "Adjusted EBITDA" only when explicitly defined as EBITDA and shown by currency).
    - Capture the currency identifier for each EBITDA figure exactly as disclosed and associate it to the correct EBITDA amount.
    - Accept only disclosures where the breakdown dimension is currency, not geography or segment unless the disclosure explicitly reports EBITDA by currency.
    - If both individual currencies and a total are shown, extract all currency-level EBITDA figures and the explicit total if present.
    - Extract EBITDA amounts only for the period explicitly referenced in the same disclosure (table, note, or narrative).

  exclusions: |
    - Do not extract operating profit, EBIT, EBT, net income, gross profit, or cash flow measures unless explicitly labeled as EBITDA.
    - Do not extract EBITDA margin, percentages, ratios, or growth rates; exclude any non-monetary values even if presented near EBITDA.
    - Do not extract figures presented solely as translated or presentation-currency conversions unless explicitly described as EBITDA generated by currency.
    - Do not extract adjustment line items, depreciation/amortization, or reconciliation components unless the disclosure explicitly reports the resulting EBITDA by currency.
    - Do not extract FX impacts, translation differences, sensitivity analyses, hedge results, or derivative gains/losses that are not stated as EBITDA amounts by currency.
