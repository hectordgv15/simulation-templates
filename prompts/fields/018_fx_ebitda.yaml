field_type: quantitative
area: Performance metrics; Currency breakdown of operating profitability

operational_definition: |
  Monetary amount of EBITDA explicitly reported for each currency, as presented in the financial statements or
  management reporting for the stated reporting period. EBITDA must be stated as an amount (not a margin or
  percentage) and must be directly associated with a specific currency through labels, headers, or narrative
  wording (e.g., "EBITDA in USD", "EBITDA generated in GBP", "EBITDA by currency").

field_constraints:
  specifications: |
    - Extract only amounts explicitly labeled as "EBITDA" and explicitly linked to a currency.
    - Accept "Adjusted EBITDA" only when the document explicitly presents a currency breakdown for that specific metric.
    - Treat a currency as valid only if it is stated in the same table, line item, or sentence as the EBITDA amount via
      a currency code, symbol, or clear label (e.g., "EBITDA (USD)", "EBITDA in GBP", column header "USD").
    - If multiple EBITDA variants are shown (EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Recurring EBITDA), extract the metric explicitly
      titled "EBITDA by currency". If no such title exists, extract only the exact metric requested by the table/label.
    - If multiple periods are displayed, extract the amounts for the current reporting period only, exactly as presented.
    - If the document provides a table with currencies as columns and "EBITDA" as a row (or vice versa), extract the
      EBITDA amounts for each currency shown and preserve each currency identifier as displayed.

  exclusions: |
    - Do not derive EBITDA from EBIT, operating profit, cash flow, or reconciliation components.
    - Do not extract EBITDA margins, percentages, ratios, or growth rates (e.g., "EBITDA margin", "% change").
    - Do not extract "constant currency EBITDA", "EBITDA excluding FX", or FX impact lines unless they are explicitly
      presented as an EBITDA monetary amount by currency.
    - Do not include foreign exchange gains/losses, translation differences, or "effect of exchange rates on EBITDA".
    - Do not include segment EBITDA or geographic EBITDA unless the document explicitly states that the dimension is
      currency (not geography/segment) and labels the amounts as EBITDA by currency.
