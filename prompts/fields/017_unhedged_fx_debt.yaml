field_constraints: 
  specifications: |
    - Extract only the amount explicitly identified as "uncovered", "unhedged", or "without hedging" foreign-currency debt.
    - Accept an amount presented as "net exposure" only if the text expressly defines it as unhedged debt (not as an overall
      net position).
    - If the document reports unhedged debt by currency and also provides a total, extract the explicit total unhedged debt.
    - If the amount appears within an FX risk table, extract the row/column referring to "debt" and "uncovered/unhedged",
      not other exposures.
    - Report only the total unhedged/uncovered foreign-currency debt for the period-end. Do not extract intermediate figures.

  exclusions: |
    - Do not include functional-currency debt, nor foreign-currency debt hedged by derivatives, forward exchange contracts,
      FX swaps, options, insurance, or explicitly indicated natural hedging.
    - Do not include derivative amounts (fair value, hedging notional) unless they are identified as unhedged debt.
    - Do not include exposure related to foreign-currency assets, trade receivables/payables, cash/treasury balances, or a
      general "net position" if it is not debt.
    - Do not include sensitivity analyses (P&L/equity impact from exchange-rate changes) or stress-testing scenarios.
    - Do not include limits, policies, hedge ratios/percentages, or ranges; only the monetary amount of unhedged debt.
