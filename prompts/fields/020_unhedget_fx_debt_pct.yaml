field_constraints:
  specifications: |
    - Extract only a percentage explicitly labeled as "unhedged", "uncovered", "not hedged", or "without hedging" for foreign-currency debt.
    - Accept only if the disclosure explicitly links the percentage to "debt", "borrowings", or "loans" denominated in foreign currency.
    - If both "hedged %" and "unhedged/uncovered %" are presented for foreign-currency debt, extract the explicitly stated unhedged/uncovered percentage.
    - If presented in a table, extract the cell corresponding to "debt/borrowings" and "unhedged/uncovered" at period-end.
    - If multiple percentages exist (by currency and total), extract the explicit total unhedged percentage; do not aggregate currency lines.
    - Preserve the percentage exactly as stated (including decimals) and keep the period-end context when stated alongside the figure.

  exclusions: |
    - Do not infer the unhedged percentage from hedge coverage %, hedged %, or any complementary ratio (no subtraction or transformation).
    - Do not use percentages related to forecast transactions, revenues, costs, net investments, cash flows, or balance-sheet items other than debt.
    - Do not include qualitative coverage statements without an explicit percentage.
    - Do not include sensitivity analyses, stress tests, VaR outputs, or percentage impacts on profit/equity from exchange-rate movements.
    - Do not include percentages related to derivative notionals, fair values, or hedge effectiveness unless explicitly stated as the share of foreign-currency debt that is unhedged/uncovered.
